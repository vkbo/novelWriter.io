Installing on MacOS
*******************

.. _GitHub: https://github.com/vkbo/novelWriter
.. _Releases: https://github.com/vkbo/novelWriter/releases

You can install novelWriter with both its Python and library dependencies embedded using the DMG
application image file from :ref:`main_download`, or from the Releases_ page on GitHub_.
Installing it should be straightforward.

* Download the DMG file and open it. Then drag the novelWriter icon to the :guilabel:`Applications`
  folder on the right. This will install it into your :guilabel:`Applications`.
* The first time you try to launch it, it will say that the bundle cannot be verified, simply press
  the :guilabel:`Open` button to add an exception.
* If you are not presented with an :guilabel:`Open` button in the dialog, launch the application
  again by right clicking on the application in Finder and selecting :guilabel:`Open` from the
  context menu.

The context menu can also be accessed by option-clicking if you have a one button mouse. This is
done by holding down the option key on your keyboard and clicking on the application in Finder.

.. note::
   The novelWriter DMG is not signed because Apple doesn't currently provide a way for non-profit
   open source projects to properly sign their installers. The novelWriter project doesn't have the
   funding to pay for a commercial software signing certificate.
