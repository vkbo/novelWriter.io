      A markdown-like text editor designed for writing novels and larger projects of many smaller
      plain text documents.

      It is designed to be a simple text editor that allows for easy organisation of text files and
      notes, with a meta data syntax for comments, synopsis, and cross-referencing between files,
      and built on plain text files for robustness.
