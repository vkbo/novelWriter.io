      novelWriter allows you to break down your novel in whatever way you need, and into as many
      documents as you want to. You can drag and drop them into a custom order, and organised them
      into folders. Documents can even have sub-documents.

      Cross-references to your project notes are defined by convenient meta keyword/value tags in
      your documents and notes. You can also insert comments that can be included in the
      manuscript.

      When you have structured the main sections of your novel in terms of chapters and scenes,
      you can switch to the **Novel View** instead.

      The **Novel View** lets you see the full structure of your novel in terms of headings rather
      than document files. You can still open each chapter or scene for editing like from
      the regular **Project Tree**.

      The **Outline View** gives you a complete overview of the structure of your novel in terms of
      your chapters and scenes.

      It also shows you all the associated meta data and cross-references in columns. A default set
      of columns are visible, but you can add more from the configuration button in the toolbar.

      The **Build Manuscript** tool lets you assemble all your files into a single document. You
      can filter what to include to make a manuscript, make a draft of your novel outline, or
      compile a document of all your notes.

      The result can be printed or saved to an Open Document, a Word Document, as well as PDF, HTML
      and Markdown. The `Open Document`_ format is supported by most open source and commercial
      word processors. You can also print the manuscript.

      novelWriter comes with a number of colour themes. You also have several icon themes and icon
      styles to choose from. The icon colours are matched to the colour theme.

      In addition, you can choose from a number of light and dark document "syntax" themes for the
      text editor and viewer. These are chosen separately from the GUI theme as there are a lot
      more of them.

      **Document Viewer**

      Any document, including the document youâ€™re editing, can be viewed in parallel in a separate
      view panel.

      **Editor Focus Mode**

      In **Focus Mode**, the editor covers the full window, hiding away the project tree and the
      view panel so you can focus on your text.

   .. grid-item::
      :padding: 1 0 3 0

      **Follow Links & References**

      Tags and references are clickable in the viewer and control-clickable in the editor so you
      can quickly navigate between your notes while writing.

      Documents open in the view panel will also have a list of all other documents pointing back
      to it in the **References** box at the bottom.
