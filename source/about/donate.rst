Devloping and maintaining novelWriter doesn't cost a lot, aside from the modest cost of the
website, but I do use about 4-500 hours a year on the project.

The development is mostly fuelled by coffee, so it is only appropriate that I set up a small
donations page on ko-fi. Any contribution is appreciated!
