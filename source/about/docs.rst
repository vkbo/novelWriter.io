Documentation
*************

This website includes the documentation for the latest full release of novelWriter as a
convenience. However, the main documentation page is hosted on ReadTheDocs. The version hosted
there has documentation available for multiple releases of novelWriter, including for the current
development efforts.

The "Stable" version of the documentation always points to the latest release, and should be the
same documentation as available on this website.

The "Latest" version is the documentation for the next release (minor or major) of novelWriter, and
may include information that does not match with the version you have installed.

At the bottom of the left hand menu of the documentation, you can find a small box to change which
version of the documentation to display. As a general rule the last 10 patched releases should be
available in the list.
