novelWriter is an open source plain text editor designed for writing novels assembled from
individual text documents. It uses a minimal formatting syntax inspired by Markdown, and adds a
meta data syntax for comments, synopsis, and cross-referencing. It is designed to be a simple text
editor that allows for easy organisation of text and notes, using human readable text files as
storage for robustness.
