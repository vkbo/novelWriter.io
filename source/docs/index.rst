novelWriter is an open source plain text editor designed for writing novels assembled from
individual text documents. It uses a minimal formatting syntax inspired by Markdown, and adds a
meta data syntax for comments, synopsis, and cross-referencing. It is designed to be a simple text
editor that allows for easy organisation of text and notes, using human readable text files as
storage for robustness.

The project storage is suitable for version control software, and also well suited for file
synchronisation tools. All text is saved as plain text files, and your project data as standard
data formats in XML and JSON. See :ref:`a_storage` for more details.

Any operating system that has Python 3 and the Qt 5 libraries should be able to run novelWriter.
It runs fine on Linux, Windows and MacOS, and users have tested it on other platforms as well.
See :ref:`a_started` for more details.
