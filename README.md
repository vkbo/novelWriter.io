This is the source repository for the [novelWriter.io](https://novelwriter.io) website.

If you want to submit corrections to the documentation, that needs to be done on the main
[novelWriter Repository](https://github.com/vkbo/novelWriter). The documentation is located in the
`docs` folder.

The documentation in this repository is just a copy, and is overwritten from the main application
repository on each release.
